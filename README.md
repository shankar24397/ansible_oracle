# ansible_oracle

We will be using a oracle super user to connect to the oracle db on remote server.

This repoistory contains the workaround solution for connecting to remote server (unix) on which oracle db is present, 

This repo contains usercases - "create new user" in oracle database using shell module commands and "password reset" for existing users using ansible shell module.

Hope it helps!
